In order to successfully produce the software for this project it is nessaccary to produce a specification for the system
that will provide the constraints on the scope on the system that can be used to assess the progress of the product
With this system the requirements are mainly motivated by providing a practical implementatoion of photon mapping, as a result
this will be the most important requirement, as with any computer graphics product the requirements should be influenced by the
desired result of the system, we can consider the ability of the system to simulate certain phenomena as being requirements,
these phenomena, in paticular we will concentrate on phenomena which photon mapping has been identified as being a good candidate
for producting, this includes diffuse intereflection, colour bleeding, caustics and multiple scattering in participating media.
Other requirements arise from more practical considerations, namely that the system should be able to run on a variaty of
hardware with different capabilities, in paticular advances in cpu design has lead to many machines including multiple cores
with which we can utilise so the design of the system should be such that we are able to scale the system to match the 
hardware.
