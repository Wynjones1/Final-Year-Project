\label{chap:reqs}
In order to successfully develope the system for this project it is nessaccary to produce a specification for the system
that will provide the constraints on the scope on the system that can be used to assess the progress of the product
With this system the requirements are mainly motivated by providing a practical implementatoion of photon mapping, as a result
this will be the most important requirement, as with any computer graphics product the requirements should be influenced by the
desired result of the system, we can consider the ability of the system to simulate certain phenomena as being requirements,
these phenomena, in paticular we will concentrate on phenomena which photon mapping has been identified as being a good candidate
for producting, this includes diffuse intereflection, colour bleeding, caustics and multiple scattering in participating media.
Other requirements arise from more practical considerations, namely that the system should be able to run on a variaty of
hardware with different capabilities, in paticular advances in CPU design has lead to muliple cores being common place allowing
for parallel operation of our system as such we should attempt to design the system such that it scales well with respect
to CPU cores.

\section{Requirements}
In this section we shall provide a listing of the requirements that have been decided upon for this project, these
requirements will be used to inform the decision in the next chapter and to evaluate the sucess of the project.
The terms must indicate that the requirement is not optional and must be implemented to fulfill the aims of the project,
should indicates that the requirement is a feature that is desirable but may be forgon if constriants during implementation
require it.
