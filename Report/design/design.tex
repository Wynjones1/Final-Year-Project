\section{Introduction}
In this chapter I will discuss the design aspect of the project, this will include an overview of the
architecture that I have decided upon and the rational behind it, I will then move to describe key components of
the design and how they relate to the aims and goals of this project.

\section{Architectural Overview}
During the requirements analysis stage of this project it was clear that the project could be decomposed into
two main sub-modules, a front-end that will perform the interaction with the user and the operating system and a
back end that will process the user input in order to synthesis image this can be seen in 
Figure~/ref{fig:design\_blocks}, the design of the project is such that the concerns of input and data processing
are seperated allowing for a cleaner design within each of the blocks.
