\section{Introduction}
In this chapter we will discuss the design aspect of the project, this will include an overview of the
architecture that we have decided upon and the rational behind it, we will then move to describe key components of
the design and how they relate to the aims and goals of this project and any interesting problems that they
may cause in the implemtation and how we propose to solve the problem. We will also briefly disscuss the
development plan that will be used to implement the system.

\section{Architectural Overview}
During the requirements analysis stage of this project it was clear that the project could be decomposed into
two main sub-modules, a front-end that will perform the interaction with the user and the operating system and a
back end that will process the user input in order to synthesis image this can be seen in 
Figure~\ref{fig:design_blocks}, the design of the project is such that the concerns of input and data processing
are seperated allowing for a cleaner design within each of the blocks. As we will be implementing the photon mapping
algorithm it is also clear that the back-end will contain two stages, the photon map generation which will produce the
photon maps that will in addition to the scene description from the front end be used to estimate the global illumination
of the scene.
