Global illumination aims to simulate the light transfer of a scene .This project documents the development of
a system that performs the photon mapping algorithm with the aim of 
approximating the global illumination of a scene. We include an overview of the history of global illumination
and the techniques that have been developed to simulate it. We then develop a design for a system
that will perform photon mapping and detail the implementation including any challenges that were faces during
the implementation. We conclude with a description of testing performed and provide example images from the
system to showcase its capabilities.
