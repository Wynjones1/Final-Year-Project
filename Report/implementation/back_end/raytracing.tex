\section{Raytracing}
We will now discuss the implemenation of the raytracer used in the system to find the intersection points and shading specular
surfaces. Multiple raytracing threads are created, these threads are passed a pointer to a queue that when read returns a
pixel coordinate that the thread will trace, this queue is written by an additional thread that will write each pixel in the
output image as space becomes available in the queue, the queue is of sufficient size so as the raytracing threads do not
exhaust the thread. In order to signal to the raytracing thread that the render has finished a flag can be set with the pixel
data that indicates that the thread should finish executing one finish signal is sent to each of the threads.

\begin{algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}
\caption{Raytracing Main Thread}
\For{ 0 to num\_threads}
	\State \Call{start\_thread}{input\_queue, output\_queue}
\EndFor

\For{ 0 to num\_pixels}
	\State pixel\_data $\gets$ \Call{queue\_read}{output\_queue}
	\State \Call{update\_pixel}{pixel\_data}
\EndFor

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}
\caption{Raytracing Processing Thread}

\State pixel\_data  $\gets$ \Call{queue\_read}{input\_queue}

\While{pixel\_data.continue}
	\State colour $\gets$ black
	\For{each sample in pixel}
		\State colour += \Call{trace\_pixel}{}
	\EndFor
	\State \Call{queue\_write}{output\_queue, pixel\_data.x, pixel\_data.y, colour}
	\State pixel\_data  $\gets$ \Call{queue\_read}{input\_queue}
\EndWhile

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Multisampling}
For each pixel that a raytrace thread receives mulitple rays are traced through the scene in order to perform multisampling
on the pixel, this allows us to remove aliasing in the final image and perform districution raytracing, we perform stratified
sampling of the pixel area to calcualte the location of each of the sub-pixels.

\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.4\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/renders/aa.png}
	\caption{25 samples per pixel}
\end{subfigure}

\subsection{Scene Traversal}

\todo{Add some detail here}

\begin{algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}
\caption{Scene Traversal Algorithm}
\State colour   $\gets$ scene.sky\_colour
\State record.t $\gets \infty$
\For{object $\in$ scene}
	\State new\_record $\gets$ \Call{intersects}{ray, object}
	\If{new\_record.hit \textbf{and} new\_record.t $\textless$ record.t}
	\State record $\gets$ new\_record
	\EndIf
\EndFor
\If{record.hit}
	\State colour $\gets$ \Call{shade}{scene, record}
\EndIf
\State \Return colour
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Self Intersection}
Due to the floating point errors in the calculation of intersection tests the point of intersection that is reported may be
slightly incorrect, this inaccuracy can cause issues for reflection, transmission and shadows as the intersection of the
specular or shadow ray reports an intersection point close to the original intersection point, this can cause artifacts in
the final render, to remedy this issue we use a small offset in the direction of the incident ray so that the origin of the
new ray is slightly above the intersection point.

\subsubsection{Volume Intersection}
Unlike intersection with all other object types the intersection with a participating media is non deterministic, this is
due to the fact that the intersection of the ray is determined by the extinction coefficient which gives a probablilty
of interaction, the depth of the interaction is calculated with equation \todo{add equation}, performing this non-deterministic
intersection test allows for objects within the medium to be interacted with when performing ray-marching.

\subsubsection{Intersection Storage}
When raytracing the scene the intersection point of the ray needs to be calculated and stored, this will include data that
is specific to an objects intersection, for example an intersection with a triangle mesh will need to record the trangle
that was intersected and as a result will need to record the barycentric coordinate at the point of intersection.
