\section{Raytracing}
\subsection{Pixel Sampling}
As the raytracer is performing distribution raytracing each thread will perform multiple raytracing operations for each pixel
that it processes each sample per pixel is offset inside the pixel to perform antialiasing, this reduces the sharp edges that
can be seen in images. In order to improve the appearence of the image we also perform jittering on the samples this reduces
certain artifacts such as banding. \todo{Make sure the banding comment is correct and if so find a reference for it}

\subsection{Intersection Tests (0.5 pages)}
Intersection tests are another vital part of any raytracer. a number of intersection tests are needed, I will not include
an extensive treatment of the intersection tests mearly a listing of the most notable used.

\begin{description}
\item[Triangle] Moller-Trumbore intersection test \cite{MolTru97}
\item[AABB]
\item[kD-tree] As described in TODO:
\end{description}

\subsection{volume intersection}
Unlike intersection with all other object types the intersection with a participating media is non deterministic, this is
due to the fact that the intersection of the ray is determined by the extinction coefficient which gives a probablilty
of interaction, the depth of the interaction is calculated with equation \todo{add equation}, performing this non-deterministic
intersection test allows for objects within the medium to be interacted with when performing ray-marching.

\subsection{Intersection Storage}
When raytracing the scene the intersection point of the ray needs to be calculated and stored, this will include data that
is specific to an objects intersection, for example an intersection with a triangle mesh will need to record the trangle
that was intersected and as a result will need to record the barycentric coordinate at the point of intersection.
