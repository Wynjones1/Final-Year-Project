In this section I will briefly discuss some data structures that are used as part of the system that cannot
be catagorised as being in the front or the back end.

Due to the small standard library provided by C many features that are commonly found in more high level languages are not
found in C, for this project we need three such data structures, lists queues and vectors.

\subsection{Lists}
\subsection{Queue}
During the photon mapping stage of the back end we need to coordinate a number of threads that is dependant on runtime inputs,
the problems that we faced during the development were distribution of work and coolation of the results of each thread,
the solution that we decided upon in both cases was to use a thread-safe queue implementation.

\subsection{Vectors}
