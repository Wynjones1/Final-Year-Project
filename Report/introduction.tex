\section{Aims}
This project aims to create a program that will synthesis images using photon mapping to produce an accurate simulation of the
light transfer of a scene. Creating realistic images is a key problem in computer graphics as the use of CGI within the
entertainment industry has become common place and relied upon as a method for creating visual effects realism is often strived
for. In addition to performing photon mapping I will also develop a new method for simulating laser light within a scene, this
method will modify the photon mapping algorithm to facilitate this.

\section{Global Illuminiation}
As the use of computers has become more prevalant in everyday life so has its use in the arts, a leading area of research is
computer generated imagery we the aim of producing images that appear to accuratly simulate the way in which light interacts
with the world, global illumination techniques aim to acheive this through simulation of the light transport equation, a true
solution to this equation is computationally infeasable. \todo{add path tracer and why we need photon mapping}

\section{Structure}
This document will begin with a description of the research surrounding my project that I have used to draw from. I will then move
onto the requirements for the system thena description of the design and then the implementation of the system including
aspects of the implementation that were interesting or presented a paticular challange.
