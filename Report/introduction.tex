\section{Aims}
This project amis to create a system that will synthesis images using the photon mapping algorithm to estimate the
global illumination of a scene, in paticualar we aim to simulate lighting phenomena such as colour exchange between
diffuse surfaces, caustics caused by specualar objects.

\section{Global Illuminiation}
As the use of computers has become more prevalant in everyday life so has its use in the arts, a leading area of research is
computer generated imagery we the aim of producing images that simulate the way in which light interacts
with the world, global illumination techniques aim to acheive this through simulation of the light transport equation, a true
solution to this equation is frequently computationally infeasable, techniques have been developed that estimate the contribution
due to indirect lighting that seek to reduce the computational cost that give a correct solution to the rendering equation at
the limit, one such technique is photon mapping.

\section{Structure}
This document will begin with a description of the research surrounding my project that I have used to draw from. I will then
move onto the requirements for the system thena description of the design and then the implementation of the system including
aspects of the implementation that were interesting or presented a paticular challange.
