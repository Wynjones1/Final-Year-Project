\subsection{Irradiance Caching}
Along with the photon map, irradiance caching is a strategy to reduce the computation in order to
produce a correct image, developed by Ward et al. \cite{Ward88}. The algorithm stored irradiance
values calculated on lambertian diffuse surfaces in a data structure that allows for the values
to be interpolated for other points on the surface, this is done with the assumption that the
values will be slowly varing over the surface. A thorough explination of irradiance caching with
respect to photon mapping can be found by Jensen \cite{JensenBook}
