In this chapter we shall discuss background literature relating to the aims of this project as
having a good understanding of the work of others and the motivations for their work will provide
a basis for the work undertaken in the project.

\section{Flux}
The photon mapping algorithm is based around emitting photons from light sources, the unit of measurement of a photon is
Radiant flux $\Phi$ is a measurement of radiant energy with respect to time \cite{JensenBook}, the SI unit of flux is the watt (W).
Flux is a spectral phenomena with its energy being distributed in different wavelengths, in this project we will only consider
three wavelengths red, green, and blue.

\section{Radiance}
Radiance commonly referers to two quantities, incident radiance and exitance radiance, incident radiance being the radiance
that fall on a surface, exitance radiance being radiance from a surface (either from reflection or emission). Radiance
is a measure of the radiant flux that falls within a given solid angle in a direction above a surface.

\section{Path Notation}
The radiance estimate on the right hand side of the rendering equation is typically evaluated by a recursive call to the
procedure that evaluates radiance at a point in the direction $\omega'$, as we perform more evaluation we create a path
from the eye to the final destination of the ray, it is frequently convienient to refer to these paths by the interaction
that the ray has with surfaces along the path, we use a regular expression language to express these paths, tokens in the
language include:
\begin{description}
\item[E] The eye or camera
\item[D] A diffuse surface
\item[S] A specular surface.
\item[L] A light
\end{description}

Paths begin with the eye and end at a light, a full solution to the rendering equation will evaluate the radiance due
to all paths \textbf{E(S\textbar D)*L}, raytracing evaluates all paths \textbf{ES*DL}
