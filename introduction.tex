\section{Aims}
This project aims to create a program that will synthesis images using photon mapping to produce an accurate simulation of the
light transfer of a scene. Creating realistic images is a key problem in computer graphics as the use of CGI within the
entertainment industry has become common place and relied upon as a method for creating visual effects realism is often strived
for. In addition to performing photon mapping I will also develop a new method for simulating laser light within a scene, this
method will modify the photon mapping algorithm to facilitate this.

\section{Structure}
This document will begin with a description of the research surrounding my project that I have used to draw from. I will then move
onto the requirements for the system thena description of the design and then the implementation of the system including
aspects of the implementation that were interesting or presented a paticular challange.
