Photon mapping is an advanced rendering method that solves the rendering equation efficiently. This project aims to produce a rendering system that uses photon mapping to render arbitrary scenes accurately, the system also includes an modification to the photon mapping algorithm to include a laser photon map that will store radiance information from highly coherent and monochromatic light
sources. This document begins with an overview of photon mapping and related algorithms and then moves on to a description of
the new algorithm, we then describe the system design and then discuss implementation details.
